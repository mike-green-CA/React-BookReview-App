# React-BookReview-App

This was an application we made in our React JS course!

The app reads rudientary book data from a JSON file; although frankly you could make minor tweaks and hook it up some sort of API. 

The main purpose of this project was to display and organize the data however.

This project was made on CodeSandBox.io and I simply downloaded my project from there created this repo and pushed it; so if you'd like to view it; 
I suggest just doing that but backwards

:)
